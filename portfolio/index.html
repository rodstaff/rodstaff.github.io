     <h3>Some of the Apps that I have created.</h3>
     <em>Note:  The links might take a few seconds to load.</em><br/><br/>

	     <a href="https://appnewsletter.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Panacea</a>
	     
	     <p>"Panacea" is adapted from a tutorial and is coded in Ruby on Rails using SendGrid and MailerChimp plugins for email and subscription purposes respectively.  It is an app where users share their personal anecdotes to make other people laugh or smile.  This is an experimental site.</p><br/>

         <a href="https://redux-react-router.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Redux-React-Routes</a>
     
         <p>"Redux-React-Routes" is coded in ReactJS + React-Router and using the Redux framework.  To simplify deployment to Heroku, I used express as a server to run the static files index.html and bundle.js which was created from another <a href="https://github.com/rodstaff/redux-react-routes" target="_blank">app </a>using webpack and transferred here.  Creating this app is not as easy as it may seem:  The challenges I faced are detailed <a href="https://github.com/rodstaff/redux-react-heroku" target="_blank">here </a>(in "README.md").</p> 

	     <a href="https://mytextingapp.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">MyTextingApp</a>
	  
	     <p>"MyTextingApp" is coded in JavaScript using NodeJS/Express with Twilio SMS texting.  I created this app from scratch and it sends me a text after the visitor inputs the correct phone number format.</p><br/>

	     <a href="/">Home</a>
	  
	     <p>I created this website using a static site generator called Jekyll.  All the source code of this portfolio page is available on Github.</p><br/>
