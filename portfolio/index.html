     <h3>Some of the Apps that I have created.</h3>
     <em>Note:  &nbsp;&nbsp;All apps listed here are deployed to https://[appName].herokuapp.com.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Each may take a few seconds to load.</em>

         <h5><a href="https://famu-tants-heroku.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Famu-Tants</a></h5>
     
         <p>"Famu-Tants" is coded in ReactJS + React-Router and using the Redux framework.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Its playfullness hides the 'awesomeness' of its applicability to much bigger and more complex apps!</p>

         <h5><a href="https://justdoit-heroku.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">JustDoIt</a></h5>
     
         <p>"Just-Do-It" is coded in ReactJS in ES6.  It is a todo list using CRUD functions.  A seemingly simple app that requires lengthy and tricky code!</p> 

	     <h5><a href="https://mytextingapp.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">MyTextingApp</a></h5>
	  
	     <p>"My-Texting-App" is coded using the NodeJS+Express framework with Twilio SMS or text messaging utilizing Twilio RESTful API.  &nbsp;&nbsp;The app sends me a text after the visitor inputs precisely the correct phone number format.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I created this from scratch.</p>

	     <h5><a href="https://panacea8.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Panacea</a></h5>
	     
	     <p>"Panacea" is coded in Ruby on Rails using SendGrid and MailerChimp plugins for email and subscription purposes respectively.  &nbsp;&nbsp;It is an app where users share their personal anecdotes to make other people laugh or smile.  &nbsp;&nbsp;This is an experimental site.</p>

	     <h5><a href="/">Home</a></h5>
	  
	     <p>I created this website using a static site generator called Jekyll (based on Ruby) which I became comfortable using in less than an hour!  &nbsp;&nbsp;I chose Jekyll for its simplicity and for easy editing and uploading remotely on your local terminal.  &nbsp;&nbsp;All the source code of this portfolio page is available on Github.</p><br/>
