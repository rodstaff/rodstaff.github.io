     <h4>Here are some of the Websites/Apps that I have created. &nbsp;&nbsp;Please enjoy them as much as I did in developing them while freely employing some <em>artistic liberties</em>.</h4><em>Note: &nbsp;&nbsp;Except for this website, all websites/apps that are listed here are deployed in www.heroku.com.  &nbsp;&nbsp;There is an initial load time.</em>

         <h4><a href="https://proseed-heroku.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">ProSeed</a></h4>
     
         <p>"Pro-Seed" is a demo website which I coded from scratch in ReactJS in ES6/NodeJS/Express using Bootstrap and in-line styling. &nbsp;&nbsp;It's a scroll type website. &nbsp;&nbsp;If you like this and need help upgrading your website using ReactJS, let me know.</p>

         <h4><a href="https://proseed2-heroku.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">ProSeed2</a></h4>
     
         <p>"Pro-Seed2" is almost an exact replica of "Pro-Seed" above, differing only in the Team section photos. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Data sizes are indicated at the top/bottom part of the images/photos, fyi.) &nbsp;&nbsp;This is intentional to show how high-resolution photos can affect loading times. &nbsp;&nbsp;ReactJS alone will not make your website or app snappy and quick, but you still have to optimize all photo/image resolution, among other things.</p>

         <h4><a href="https://famu-tants-heroku.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">FamuTants</a></h4>
     
         <p>"Famu-Tants" is coded in ReactJS with React-Router and Redux. &nbsp;&nbsp;Its playful nature hides its real capacity to make much more complex applications not only more manageable but snappier and quicker!</p> 

         <h4><a href="https://justdoit-heroku.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">JustDoIt</a></h4>
     
         <p>"Just-Do-It" is coded in ReactJS in ES6/NodeJS/Express. &nbsp;&nbsp;It is a todo list using CRUD functions. &nbsp;&nbsp;A seemingly simple app that requires lengthy and tricky code!</p> 

	<!--      <h5><a href="https://mytextingapp.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">MyTextingApp</a></h5>
	  
	     <p>"My-Texting-App" is coded using the NodeJS+Express framework with Twilio SMS or text messaging utilizing Twilio RESTful API.  &nbsp;&nbsp;The app sends me a text after the visitor inputs precisely the correct phone number format.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I created this from scratch.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Updated version coming soon!</p> -->

	     <h4><a href="https://panacea8.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Panacea</a></h4>
	     
	     <p>"Panacea" is coded in Ruby on Rails using SendGrid and MailerChimp plugins for email and subscription purposes respectively.  &nbsp;&nbsp;It is an app where users share their personal anecdotes to make other people laugh or smile.  &nbsp;&nbsp;This is an experimental site.</p>

	     <h4><a href="/">MyWebsite</a></h4>
	  
	     <p>I created this website using a static site generator called Jekyll which is based on Ruby. &nbsp;&nbsp;I chose Jekyll for its simplicity and for easy editing and uploading remotely on your local terminal.  &nbsp;&nbsp;All the source code of this portfolio page is available on Github.</p><br/>
