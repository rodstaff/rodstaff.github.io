     <h3>Some of the Apps that I have created.</h3>
     <em>Note:  The links might take a few seconds to load.</em>

         <h5><a href="https://redux-react-heroku.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Redux-React-Routes</a></h5>
     
         <p>"Redux-React-Routes" is coded in ReactJS + React-Router and using the Redux framework.  &nbsp;&nbsp;To simplify deployment to Heroku, I used NodeJS/Express as a background server to run the static files index.html and bundle.js which was created from <a href="https://github.com/rodstaff/redux-react-routes" target="_blank">&nbsp;<d>another app</d>&nbsp;</a>using webpack.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Creating this app was not so easy:  &nbsp;&nbsp;The challenges I faced are detailed <a href="https://github.com/rodstaff/redux-react-heroku" target="_blank"><d>here</d>&nbsp;</a>(in "README.md").</p> 

         <h5><a href="">myCV</a></h5>
     
         <p>"myCV" is my own resume and I coded it in ReactJS + React-Router w/o Redux.  If you are a hiring manager or recruiter, please let me know if you would like to see it and I would be very happy to send you a link and a copy of the source code.</p> 
	     <h5><a href="https://mytextingapp.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">MyTextingApp</a></h5>
	  
	     <p>"MyTextingApp" is coded using the NodeJS+Express framework with Twilio SMS or text messaging utilizing Twilio RESTful API.  &nbsp;&nbsp;The app sends me a text after the visitor inputs precisely the correct phone number format.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I created this from scratch.</p>

	     <h5><a href="https://appnewsletter.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Panacea</a></h5>
	     
	     <p>"Panacea" is adapted from a tutorial and is coded in Ruby on Rails using SendGrid and MailerChimp plugins for email and subscription purposes respectively.  &nbsp;&nbsp;It is an app where users share their personal anecdotes to make other people laugh or smile.  &nbsp;&nbsp;This is an experimental site.</p>

	     <h5><a href="/">Home</a></h5>
	  
	     <p>I created this website using a static site generator called Jekyll (based on Ruby) which I became comfortable using in less than an hour!  &nbsp;&nbsp;I chose Jekyll for its simplicity and for easy editing remotely on your local terminal.  &nbsp;&nbsp;All the source code of this portfolio page is available on Github.</p><br/>
