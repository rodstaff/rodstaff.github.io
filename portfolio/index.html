     <h3>Some of the basic Apps I have done.</h3>
     <em>Note:  The links might take a few seconds to load.</em><br/><br/>

	     <a href="https://appnewsletter.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Panacea</a>
	     
	     <p>"Panacea" is coded in Ruby on Rails using SendGrid and MailerChimp plugins.  It is a newsletter app where prospective users visit the site to share their personal funny stories to make other people laugh or smile.  This is an experimental site.</p><br/>

         <a href="">Redux-React-Routes</a>
     
         <p>"Redux-React-Routes" is coded in ReactJS using the Redux framework.  It is a simple app that I combined using at least three sources and it serves as template for much bigger and complex apps that would benefit from the Redux framework.  It is a playful presentation of some famous people and the Mutant Ninja Turtles!</p><br/>

	     <a href="https://mytextingapp.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">MyTextingApp</a>
	  
	     <p>"MyTextingApp" is coded in JavaScript using NodeJS/Express with Twilio SMS texting.  It is a very simple app that sends the author a text after the visitor inputs the correct phone number format.</p><br/>

	     <a href="/">Home</a>
	  
	     <p>I created this website using a static site generator called Jekyll and posted at Github.</p><br/>
