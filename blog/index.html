	      <h2>An Easier Approach to Deploy ReactJS and Redux to Heroku Using the Webpack bundle.js File in a Super Lightweight App<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;--by Rod Kay, 10/17/2016</em></h2>

	      <h3>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;Summary</h3>

	      <p>Existing free online sources (available at the time of this writing) regarding deployment of reactJS apps especially with the redux framework are not easy to follow moreso since authors have different styles and preferences.  &nbsp;&nbsp;This blog proposes and a much simpler approach to Heroku depoyment by reducing and transforming the app into a much lighter version.&nbsp;</p>

	      <p>This blog assumes that the reader already has some background with reactJS, a bit of redux, Git source control and Heroku deployment.  This is not meant to be a tutorial but a proposal to simplify development.</p>

	      <h3>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;Development</h3>

	      <p>This blog was actually inspired by the difficulties I encountered in deploying an app I created in reactJS using react-router in a redux framework.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Coding <a href="https://github.com/rodstaff/redux-react-routes"><em>redux-react-routes</em></a> was an exciting but circuitous journey by itself; and if that were not enough, I found out later that there was no clear and definitive method available online to deploy it to Heroku! &nbsp;&nbsp;I finally realized, however, that no matter how complicated the code was, all of it (except for e.g. styling, images) would eventually bundled and coded in one consolidated javaScript file!</p>

	      <p>Below in Figs 2.1 to 2.4, I will briefly show how I created the bundle.js file by using the Webpack bundler tool.</p>
	      
	      <p><d>Fig. 2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Redux-React-Routes</em> App Folder Structure.</d></p>

	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those marked in * are folders. <br/>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those marked in (red)^ are the only files that will be used in Heroku deployment.

 <pre>
	        bsrc* --|_ <em>bundle.js^</em>           <-- bundled by Webpack

	      routes* --|_ index.js             <-- entry point of the app
	                |_ app.js               <-- topmost react-route component
	                |___ container.js  
	                |___ home.js       
	                |___.                   
	                |___.             

	         dev* --|__js*____
  	                |         |_ actions*    <-- Redux/React section
	                |         |_ components* <-- Redux/React section
	                |         |_ containers* <-- Redux/React section
	                |         |_ reducers*   <-- Redux/React section
	                |
                        |__scss*__
                        |         |_style.scss  <-- styling (for future use)
                        |
                        |_ store.js             <-- Redux/React section

         node_modules*--|_ .                    <-- module installs (included in .gitignore)
                        |_ .
                        |_ .
       
          <em>index.html^</em>
           <em>style.css^</em>
        <em>package.json^</em>
    webpack.config.js
 </pre>

      },
 </pre>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important parts of the package.json file is shown below.

 </pre>

        <p>The redux-react-routes app uses client side rendering but in development you can use webpack-dev-server which uses a background server; your code then updates automatically without refreshing the browser.  &nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, inside your working directory simply type the command shown in Fig. 2.4 in your terminal.</p>

      <p><d>Fig. 2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;Using the Webpack-Dev-Server.</d></p>
 <pre>
      $npm run dev      <-- "dev" is the script defined in package.json (see Fig. 2.3)

      localhost:8089    <-- type this in your browser window (see Fig. 2.2)
 </pre>

      <h3>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;Heroku Deployment</h3>

        <p>Once you have done sufficient debugging and testing and you're ready to proudly show the world what you have done, it's time to deploy to Heroku. &nbsp;&nbsp;For this you will need to create and copy the the bundle.js file with Webpack as shown in Fig. 3.1.</p>

 <p><d>Fig. 3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;Bundle with Webpack.</d></p>
 <pre>
      $npm run wbp                                  <-- "wbp" is the script defined in package.json (see Fig. 2.3)

      $cp bsrc/bundle.js ../<em class="noColor">newAppName</em>/bundle.js    <-- "bsrc" is the output path defined in webpack.config.js (see Fig. 2.2)
                                                    <-- <em class="noColor">newAppName</em> is the name of the new app which will be deployed to Heroku.  
 </pre>

        <p>The folder location of the "new app" should ideally be located in the same directory as your current app.  &nbsp;&nbsp;In my case, I called this separate app <a href="https://github.com/rodstaff/redux-react-heroku"><em>redux-react-heroku</em></a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;Fig. 3.2 shows its flat folder structure and as you can see, it has only a total of 6 functional files--around 20 less files (inside the folders) than the development app (compare with Fig. 2.1)!</p>

        <p><d>Fig. 3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Redux-React-Heroku App (Flat) Folder Structure.</d></p>

 <pre>
      server.js        <-- entry point of the app
      <em>bundle.js</em>          
      <em>index.html</em>
      <em>style.css</em>
      <em>package.json</em>     <-- The only file copied (in red) that will change!
      Procfile
      node_modules     <-- module installs (included in .gitignore)
 </pre>

        <p><d>Fig. 3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;The server.js File.</d></p>

 <pre>
      var express = require('express');
      var app = express();
      var port = process.env.PORT || 8080

      app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/'));

      app.listen(port);
      console.log("server running on port " + port);
 </pre>

        <p><d>Fig. 3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;The New package.json File.</d></p>

 <pre>
      "dependencies": {
        "express": "^4.14.0"
      },
      "engines": {
        "node": "4.4.3"
      }
 </pre>

        <p><d>Fig. 3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;The Procfile File.</d></p>

 <pre>
      web: node server.js
 </pre>

        <p>Figs 3.1 to 3.5 show how super lightweight this app really is!  &nbsp;&nbsp;Note that now it uses server side rendering with only 6 (5 if you don't include the console.log command) lines of code! &nbsp;&nbsp;Because the result of all the long (but fun) sleepless nights of development are finally bundled up into one single bundle.js file, you will note in Fig. 3.4 how simple the package.json file becomes.  &nbsp;&nbsp;You just need to make sure of the express and node versions that you used.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Procfile will instruct Heroku how to execute and run the app after deployment.</p>

      <h3>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</h3>
        <p>I have seen several online versions of deploying to Heroku and they differ widely depending on the coding style of the author and therefore are not very easy to follow especially if you are unfamiliar with their methods. &nbsp;&nbsp;Once you get used to any method, however, code and modules also get outdated fairly quickly so there is a good chance that your program might not even work! &nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal here is to shorten and simplify Heroku deployment by using the bundled file created by Webpack and to create a separate and simple lightweight app that will use this file simplifying the process of deployment further. &nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this was helpful.</p>
