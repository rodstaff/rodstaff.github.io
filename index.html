     <h3>Rod Kay:&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h3>
     <p>Welcome to my personal site. &nbsp;&nbsp;Besides showcasing some of the demo apps and websites that I have built in my Portfolio page, I also wanted to add more to what my Linkedin profile mentions. &nbsp;&nbsp;See below a few more details regarding my work background and experience.</p>
     <h4>Hardware Circuit Developer</h4>
     <p>During my university years I learned 8-bit Assembly, FORTRAN and BASIC. &nbsp;&nbsp;After graduation, I mostly used Pascal for hardware testing/debugging when I became an analog circuit designer in the field of nanotechnology. &nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I also used a number of Computer Aided Design (CAD) software (e.g. SPICE) to simulate device performance to meet very tight device specification.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I even tweaked with the bipolar transistor models that were used in the simulation program to fit actual data measurements.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Below was the hardware design cycle we followed:</p>
     <pre>
     (1) Specification 
     (2) Simulation 
     (3) Manufacturing 
     (4) Testing/Debugging: IF "fail" GOTO step (1) 
     (5) Quality Testing: IF "fail" GOTO step (1)
     (6) Production
     (7) Hi-Fives and Beer!

     <p>Those were days of long hours spent in front of a UNIX workstation and inside the lab but I enjoyed them immensely!</p>
     <h4>Business Developer</h4>
     <p>One day, however, I would meet a friend who would eventually convince me to do business development in the same technology industry.  &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a different kind of challenge: instead of detailed engineering reviews, I would face tough rounds of price negotiations; instead of dealing with bugs myself, I would coordinate across different departments to make sure counter-measures were quickly found so as not to impact the production schedule; delivery issues, quality issues--all sorts of commercial and customer issues!  &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a completely different world but challenging (and fun too) nevertheless. </p>
     <h4>Web Developer</h4>
     <p>In recent years, however, I have had calling--a "call back" if you will.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I have been missing those days in the "bench".  &nbsp;&nbsp;So here I am slowly but surely back in engineering since a few years ago but on the software side of things.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I even attended a bootcamp to consolidate my learning and get well acquainted with innovative, high growth companies.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy coding in NodeJS/Express and ReactJS and exploring new code that seem to come out by the week.  &nbsp;&nbsp;It is a challenging and exciting industry!</p>
     <h4><em>Ergo</em></h4>
     <p>"All work and no play?"  &nbsp;&nbsp;All the above are not really "work," they are actually my passion!  &nbsp;&nbsp;In my spare time, I also tutor math and science to both children and adults.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I love it when I help someone get into the school of their dreams or achieve the score they need on a standardized test.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I also do some cooking and intend to take it more seriously when I get a much bigger kitchen. :)</p><br/>
