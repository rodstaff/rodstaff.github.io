     <h3>Rod Kay:&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h3>
     <p>When you look for someone to get a job done in web development, you would need someone who has a solid engineering background and understanding (theoretical and pragmatic):&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, one who is flexible, a quick learner, persistent and a creative outside-of-the-box thinker; who also knows the balance between when to intensely focus independently and when to reach out collaboratively.  &nbsp;&nbsp;You would need someone with a sense of humor too.</p>
     <p>That person would be me!</p>
     <p>Now, when someone asks me how many years of experience I have in web development, or more specifically in coding, I would give an average number of three (3) but should be equivalently more, in my own personal and honest opinion.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Read below to find out why.</p>
     <h4>Circuit Developer</h4>
     <p>Back in the days when I was a hardware circuit designer (6 years) in the field of nanotechnology, I learned FORTRAN and even 8-bit Assembly.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I mostly used Pascal for testing/debugging and a number of Computer Aided Design (CAD) software to measure and simulate device performance respectively to meet device specification.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I even tweaked with the bipolar transistor models that were used in the simulation program to fit actual data measurements.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Those were days of long hours spent in front of the workstation and inside the lab.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoyed them immensely!</p>
     <h4>Business Developer</h4>
     <p>One day, however, I would meet a friend who would eventually convince me to do business development in the same technology industry.  &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a different kind of challenge: instead of device specs, I would face tough rounds of price negotiations; instead of dealing with bugs myself, I would coordinate across different departments to make sure counter-measures were quickly found so as not to impact the production schedule; delivery issues, quality issues--all sorts of commercial and customer issues!  &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a completely different world but challenging (and fun too) nevertheless. </p>
     <h4>Web Developer</h4>
     <p>In recent years, however, I have had calling--a "call back" if you will.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I have been missing those days in the "bench".  So here I am slowly but surely back in engineering since a few years ago but on the software side of things.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I even attended a bootcamp to consolidate my learning.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy coding in Node.js/Express, Ruby on Rails, Angular/React-Redux and exploring new code styles (that seem to come out by the week).  &nbsp;&nbsp;It is a challenging and exciting industry!</p>
     <h4><em>Ergo</em></h4>
     <p>Back to the coding experience discussion:  &nbsp;&nbsp;So given that I have some 6 years of engineering experience a considerable part of which involved coding, I would consider that 3 years is a reasonable estimate overall.</p>
     <h5><em>...in my spare time</em></h5>
     <p>"All work and no play?"  &nbsp;&nbsp;All the above are not work at all, they are actually my passion!  &nbsp;&nbsp;In my spare time, I also tutor math and science to both children and adults.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I love it when I help someone get into the school of their dreams or achieve the score they need on a standardized test.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I also do some cooking and intend to take it more seriously when I get a much bigger kitchen...</p><br/>
