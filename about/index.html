     <h3>Rod Kay:&nbsp&nbspIntroduction</h3>
     <p>When someone asks me how many years of experience I have in web development, or more specifically in coding, I would probably give an average number of three (3) but should be more, in my own personal and honest opinion.  Read below to find out why.</p>
     <h4>Circuit Developer</h4>
     <p>Back in the days when I was a hardware circuit designer (6 years) in the field of nanotechnology, I learned FORTRAN and even 8-bit Assembly.  I mostly used Pascal for testing/debugging and a number of Computer Aided Design (CAD) software to measure and simulate device performance respectively to meet device specification.  I even tweaked with the bipolar transistor models that were used in the simulation program to fit actual data measurements.  Those were days of long hours spent in front of the workstation and inside the lab.  I enjoyed them immensely!</p>
     <h4>Business Developer</h4>
     <p>One day, however, I would meet a friend who would eventually convince me to do business development in the same technology industry.  It was a different kind of challenge: instead of device specs, I would face tough rounds of price negotiations; instead of dealing with bugs myself, I would coordinate across different departments to make sure counter-measures were quickly found so as not to impact the production schedule; delivery issues, quality issues--all sorts of commercial and customer issues!  It was a completely different world but challenging (and fun too) nevertheless. </p>
     <h4>Web Developer</h4>
     <p>In recent years, however, I have had calling--a "call back" if you will.  I have been missing those days in the "bench".  So here I am back in engineering (since 2016) but on the software side of things.  I even attended a bootcamp to consolidate my learning.  I enjoy coding in Node.js/Express, Ruby on Rails, Angular/React-Redux and exploring new code styles that seem to come out by the week.  It is a challenging and exciting industry!</p>
     <h4><em>Ergo</em></h4>
     <p>Back to the coding experience discussion:  So given that I have some 6 years of engineering experience a considerable part of which involved coding, I would consider that 3 years is a reasonable estimate overall.</p>
     <h5><em>...in my spare time</em></h5>
     <p>"All work and no play?"  All the above are not work at all, they are actually my passion!  In my spare time, I also tutor math and science to both children and adults.  I love it when I help someone get into the school of their dreams or achieve the score they need on a standardized test.  I also do some cooking and intend to take it more seriously when I get a much bigger kitchen...</p><br/>
