     <h3>Rod Kay:&nbsp&nbspIntroduction</h3>
     <h4>Circuit Developer</h4>
     <p>Back in the days when I was a hardware circuit designer, I learned FORTRAN and even 8-bit Assembly.  I used Pascal for testing/debugging and a number of Computer Aided Design (CAD) software to simulate device performance to meet specification.  I even tweaked with the transistor models that were used in the program to fit actual data measurements.  Those were days of long hours spent in front of the workstation and inside the lab... I enjoyed it!</p>
     <h4>Business Developer</h4>
     <p>One day, however, I would meet a friend who would eventually convince me to do business development in the same technology industry.  It was a different kind of challenge: instead of device specs, I would face tough rounds of price negotiations; instead of dealing with bugs myself, I would coordinate across different departments to make sure counter-measures were quickly found so as not to impact the production schedule; delivery issues, quality issues, all sorts of issues!  It was a completely different world but challenging (and fun too) nevertheless. </p>
     <h4>Web Developer</h4>
     <p>In recent years, however, I have had calling--a "call back" if you will.  I have been missing those days in the "bench".  So here I am back in engineering but on the software side of things.  I even attended a bootcamp to consolidate my learning.  I enjoy coding in Node.js/Express, Ruby on Rails, Angular/React-Redux and exploring new code styles that seem to come out by the week.  It is a challenging and exciting industry!</p>
     <h5><em>Other Passions</em></h5>
     <p>In my spare time, I also tutor academic subjects like math, physics and standardized tests to children and adults.  Inasmuch as I enjoy learning, I also enjoy helping students finally reach their objectives.  I enjoy good chats with close friends; 
     I also like pets and [experimental] cooking, to name other things that I enjoy doing.</p>
     <p>This is a little bit longer than the usual introduction, but if you have read this far, we probably could be sharing a lot more things in common; so reach out:  Let's start a dialog!
